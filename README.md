# Injury-Risk-Predictor-Python-ML-Project
The script generates synthetic weekly data for a single player, including features such as age, previous injuries, games played, minutes, average speed, training load, recovery days, and cumulative load. It calculates a risk score and injury probability for 12 historical weeks.

Two machine learning algorithms are trained on this data:
Logistic Regression – to model the probability of injury based on player workload and history.
Random Forest Classifier – to capture more complex, nonlinear relationships in the same data.

The trained models are then used to predict injury probabilities for 4 future weeks. Probabilities are categorized into risk levels ("Risc scăzut", "Risc moderat", "Risc mare"), and results are visualized in a plot with a color-coded risk table, as in the attached print screen. 

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in simulating real-world sports performance data, preprocessing features, and applying machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) for predictive analytics. I also learned how to interpret model predictions, categorize risk levels, and visualize results effectively to support decision-making.
